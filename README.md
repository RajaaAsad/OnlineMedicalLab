# Online_Medical_Lab

•	Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL database

•	Designed and implemented a user-friendly platform medical lab website where patients can view their medical results online. Our platform provides two roles: admin and patient.

•	Admin: can perform CRUD operations on users, add medical tests, and view users' information.

•	Patient: can view his personal information and medical results and even download them for future reference         
                                            
Our website supports OOP PHP for the back-end, making the code clean and easy to understand and maintain. Additionally, we support secure access through the use of sessions.
